**JAMOVEO** is a full-stack, real-time music collaboration app built as a home assignment for Moveo.  
It enables admins to create and control jam sessions, while users can join, follow selected songs live, and play along with scrolling lyrics and chords. Jammin' was never so fun & easy!

## A programmer's note:
